    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 23, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Scrapping</strong> ("The App," "We," "Us") operates and collects information.</p>

    <p><strong>Scrapping</strong> is a data analysis tool designed to monitor and report on publicly available data from the Meta (Facebook) platform.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>

    <h3>A. Information We DO NOT Collect</h3>
    <p>The App is designed to perform its function without collecting any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from end-users. We <strong>do not</strong> require user login, we <strong>do not</strong> collect names, email addresses, IP addresses, location data, device identifiers, or any other private information belonging to you, the user of this application.</p>

    <h3>B. Information We Collect and Process</h3>
    <p>The App uses the Facebook Graph API to access and process information that is publicly available on the Facebook platform, specifically for the Facebook Page with the ID <strong>20531316728</strong> (Meta).</p>

    <p>The publicly available data we access includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Page metrics, such as the public <code>fan_count</code> (number of page likes).</li>
        <li>Public Post data, such as the post <code>message</code>, <code>created_time</code>, and aggregated engagement metrics (Likes, Comments, Shares) that are publicly displayed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This public data is processed solely for the purpose of generating the analytical output (as seen in the application's runtime) and is not stored in a persistent database or shared with any other third party.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>This App relies solely on the <strong>Facebook Graph API</strong> (provided by Meta Platforms, Inc.) to retrieve public data. By using this App, you are subject to the terms and privacy policies of Meta Platforms, Inc.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Security and Retention</h2>

    <p>Since The App does not collect or store any personal data from its users, there is no user data to secure or retain. The public data fetched from the Facebook API is processed in real-time and immediately discarded upon the completion of the script execution.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>

    <p>Since we do not collect any personal data from you, there are no specific user data rights (such as access, correction, or deletion) to exercise with respect to our application. For any privacy concerns related to the public data originating from the Meta platform, please refer to Meta's Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.</p>
